# cs50-project_downloader
Small script to get all my CS50 projects

> Note: This program needs subversion installed. The below code does not work standalone. See [how to install subversion](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/core/MAVEN/config_svn.htm#MAVEN8819).

Also get svn in python
```pip
pip install svn
```
or
```pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
